    <h1>AisleWise Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>AisleWise ("the App") is a food ingredient scanner that helps you identify potentially harmful ingredients in packaged foods. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App collects and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>AisleWise does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>Specifically:</p>
    <p>• <strong>No account required.</strong> You do not need to sign up or log in to use AisleWise.</p>
    <p>• <strong>No personal information collected.</strong> We do not collect your name, email, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>• <strong>No analytics or tracking.</strong> We do not use any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking tools.</p>
    <p>• <strong>No data shared with third parties.</strong> We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>AisleWise requests camera access solely to scan barcodes and ingredient labels. Camera data is processed entirely on your device and is never transmitted, stored, or shared. No images or video are saved.</p>

    <h2>Network Requests</h2>
    <p>When you scan a barcode, AisleWise sends the barcode number to the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank">Open Food Facts</a> API to retrieve product information including ingredient lists. This is a public, open-source database. Only the barcode number is sent — no personal or device information is included in these requests.</p>

    <h2>On-Device Storage</h2>
    <p>Your scan history is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage (UserDefaults). This data never leaves your device and is deleted when you uninstall the App or clear the history within the App.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>AisleWise does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The App does not require any personal information to function.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
